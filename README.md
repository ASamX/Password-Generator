# Password Generator with Entropy Evaluation

A Python-based password generator with built-in entropy calculation to assess the strength of generated passwords. This tool allows users to customize password characteristics such as length, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It uses entropy metrics to determine the password's strength, providing feedback on whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.

## Features
- Generate random passwords with customizable length (12 to 100 characters).
- Option to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Calculate password entropy to assess strength.
- Categorize password strength as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong."
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard for easy use.

## How It Works
1. Enter the desired password length and select the character types.
2. Click **"Generate Password"** to create a secure password.
3. The entropy-based strength rating will be displayed.
4. Copy the generated password to your clipboard with a single click.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually bundled with Python)

## Notes
- Password length must be between 12 and 100 characters.
- The entropy-based password strength rating will indicate the security of the generated password.
- This tool is designed to help you generate strong, random passwords easily.

## Usage
To run the app, simply execute the script and use the graphical interface to generate a password.
